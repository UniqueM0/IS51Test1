The program is looking to determine which option pays more (is better).
The first option is 100 dollars per day for 10 days.
The second option is 1 dollar a day with it being doubled each day for 10 days.
Two functions will be envoked to calculate each pay rate.
Function1 will calculate the payment amount in Option 1, function 2 will calculate the payment amount in Option 2.


Function1 will output 100 * 10 days
Function2 will loop 10 times, and each time it will double the amount then it will add the amount to the total.


if amount is equal, output to the user "Option 1 and Option 2 pays the same"
if Option 1 pays more, output to the user "Option 1 is better"
if Option 2 pays more, output to the user "Option 2 is better"
